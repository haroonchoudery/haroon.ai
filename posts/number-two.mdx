But it’s difficult thinking ahead, and I’m also afraid of not being able to live in the present. But am I doing that
anyway? I don’t actually think so.

Can I still live in the present whilst thinking to the future? I think so. I don’t think those things are mutually
exclusive.

So what does it look like to program myself for the future? I’m not wired to do it right now. It takes practice.

Looking at a picture of myself in old age is a good way. Another way is thinking about death, as morbid as that sounds.
Momento mori. But doesn’t that promote nihilism (“I’m going to die anyway so why care?”)? I may be thinking about it
incorrectly.
